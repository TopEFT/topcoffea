# JSONs containing corrections and systematics

Apart from the files starting with `TauFakeSF_*`, the documentation and the source of the files contained here is listed TAU POG GH repo: https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauIDSFs.git. When necessary, the central files where translated in the legacy JSON format used for TOP-22-006.

The SFs and systematic uncertainties contained in `TauFakeSF_*` represent the corrections to the estimate of the jet faking hadronic taus at a fixed WP of the `DeepTau` discriminator.
The procedure was presented to TAU POG: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1326438/#preview:4727537

The actual code used to produce the latter SFs will be committed ASAP
